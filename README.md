# ULP Compiler

The ULP Compiler (ULPCL) is a C++20 tool designed to compile **.ulp** files into **.umc** files.

## Setup

1. Download the appropriate package based on your system architecture:

    * For 64-bit systems, download `Bin-x64.zip`.
    * For 32-bit systems, download `Bin-x86.zip`.

2. Extract the dowloaded package. Upon extraction, you should find the following files:

    * `ulpcl.exe`
    * `mjfs.dll`
    * `mjmem.dll`
    * `mjstr.dll`
    * `mjsync.dll`
    * `xxhash.dll`

## How to build

To successfully build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have CMake and a compiler known to CMake properly installed.
2. Clone the repository using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/MateuszJanduraUszu/ULP-Compiler.git
```

3. Build the `ulpcl` executable:

```
build.bat {x64|Win32} "{Compiler}"
```

These steps will help you compile the project's executable using the specified platform architecture and compiler.
